In particular the following should take place:

1. the assets and information security processes should be identified and defined;
1. the entity responsible for each asset or information security process should be assigned and the details of this responsibility should be documented;
1. authorization levels should be defined and documented;
1. to be able to fulfil responsibilities in the information security area the appointed individuals should be competent in the area and be given opportunities to keep up to date with developments;
1. coordination and oversight of information security aspects of supplier relationships should be identified and documented.

1. changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator;
1. rules which require specific approval before enactment and those which do not.
